# Project Overview:


## Objective:
The primary objective of this project seems to be the analysis and prediction of player performance across various game levels, with metrics focused on accuracy and time.

## Components:
Data Generation:

We simulated data for 50 players playing across 4 levels of a game, with each level being played 3 times by each player.
Each game level had its own set of button sequences which the players had to replicate.
The players' performances were simulated using random alterations to these sequences, with the complexity of alterations increasing with the level.
The time between presses for each button was also simulated.
Feature Engineering:

Metrics such as AvgTimeBetweenPress (average time between button presses) and TotalTime (total time for the game) were derived from the generated data.
Accuracy of each player's attempt was calculated based on how well they replicated the given sequence.
Data Analysis:

Players' performance was aggregated to compute their overall accuracy and rank for each game.
Data for multiple tables (df1, df2, df3, df4) representing games were generated to simulate a scenario where players participated in multiple games.
Predictive Modeling:

We aimed to use a simple linear regression model to predict a player's accuracy in the next level based on their current level and accuracy. This can be extended further for more detailed analysis.
Visualization:

Data was visualized using scrollable tables for a cleaner representation in Jupyter notebook.
Interpretation and Conclusion:
The simulated data helps in understanding the players' performance trends across various game levels.
As expected, as the game level increases, the complexity and alteration in the players' sequences increase. This signifies the increasing difficulty of the game.
From our prediction models (although simple), game developers could gain insights into how well a player might perform in subsequent levels based on their current performance. This could be useful in customizing game difficulty or providing help/tips to players.
The data also provides metrics like TotalTime and AvgTimeBetweenPress, which could be vital for game developers to understand the usability and difficulty aspects of their game interface.
By comparing performance across multiple game tables (df1, df2, df3, df4), one can identify patterns or anomalies specific to certain games.
In conclusion, this project provides a foundation for understanding and predicting player behavior and performance in a gaming context. The insights drawn can be crucial for game developers aiming to optimize player experience and retention. While the current model and analysis are basic, there's a lot of potential to expand this into a deeper analysis with more sophisticated models, richer features, and real-world data.
